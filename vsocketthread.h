VSocketThread is an abstract base class, derived from VThread, that has
both a VSocket, on which it presumably communicates with a client, and
an owner VThread, which is presumably the VListenerThread that it.

If a subclass so chooses, it can arrange for the owner thread class to
keep track of the threads it owns, and for the owned threads to notify
the owner when they terminate. VListenerThread already implements the owner
side of this arrangement.

        I decided to make the ownerThread a VListenerThread rather
        than a generic VThread, because I don't think it's appropriate
        to make VThread have knowledge of sockets. It's less ugly
        to say that VSocketThread knows about listeners, because you
        generally use socket threads with listeners. Either way there
        is some cross-domain knowledge between threads and sockets;
        this seems the cleaner of the two options.
