    @defgroup vsocket Vault Sockets

    The Vault implements platform-independent sockets, for both clients and
    servers. The abstract base class VSocketBase defines the low-level API for dealing
    with sockets. It's low-level in the sense that most Vault users will not have
    to use this API other than calling init() to connect the socket when implementing
    a client-side connection. Instead, you'll be using classes like VSocketStream to
    associate a stream with a socket, and the upper layer stream classes to perform
    the actual socket i/o. And server implementors will similarly just be attaching
    a stream object to each socket that gets created for an incoming client connection.

    Each socket platform needs to define an implementation of the
    concrete subclass VSocket, so there is currently one defined when compiling for
    BSD/Unix sockets and one for WinSock, though these are very similar because their
    platform APIs are different mostly in small ways.

    Client code that needs to connect will instantiate a VSocket (whether this is the
    BSD version or the WinSock version just depends on what platform you are compiling
    on), and then presumably use a VSocketStream and a VIOStream to do i/o
    over the socket. Server code will typically create a VListenerThread, which will
    use a VListenerSocket, and turn each incoming connection into a VSocket and
    VSocketThread, both created via a factory that you can supply to define the
    concrete classes that are instantiated for each.

VNetworkInterfaceInfo describes an Internet interface on this computer. You can
get a list of the interfaces present by calling VSocket::enumerateNetworkInterfaces.
If you are just looking for the "local ip address", you should just call
VSocket::getLocalHostIPAddress(), which takes this information into account along
with the concept of a "preferred" interface on a multi-home system (where multiple
interfaces are active).

/**
VSocketBase is the abstract base class from which each platform's VSocket
implementation is derived. So you instantiate VSocket objects, but you
can see the API by looking at the VSocketBase class.

The basic way of using a client socket is to instantiate a VSocket (either
directly or through a VSocketFactory), and then call init() to connect to
the server.

The basic way of using a server socket is to instantiate a VListenerThread
and supplying it a VSocketFactory and a subclass of VSocketThreadFactory
that will create your kind of VSocketThread to handle requests for a given
connection.

The best way to do i/o on a socket once it's connected, is to instantiate
a VSocketStream for the socket, and then instantiate the appropriate subclass
of VIOStream to do well-typed reads and writes on the socket.

Here is how you would connect to a host, write a 32-bit integer in network
byte order, receive a similar response, and clean up:

<tt>
Vu32 exchangeSingleMessage(const VString& host, int port, Vu32 request)<br>
{<br>
VSocket    socket;<br>
socket.init(host, port);<br>
<br>
VSocketStream    stream(socket);<br>
VBinaryIOStream    io(stream);<br>
Vu32            response;<br>
<br>
io.writeU32(request);<br>
io.flush();<br>
response = io.readU32();<br>
<br>
return response;<br>
}
</tt>

FIXME:
According to some docs I have found, the proper shutdown sequence for a connected
socket is:
1. call shutdown(id, 1)    // well, not 1, so SHUT_WR or SHUT_RDWR? SHUT_RD would seem to make the next step fail
2. loop on recv until it returns 0 or any error
3. call close (or closesocket + WSACleanup on Win (is WSACleanup gone in WS2?))
