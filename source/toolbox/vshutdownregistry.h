The shutdown registry allows you to register a handler object that

you've allocated, that otherwise would have to be automatically deleted
by the operating system as part of program termination. That is, it's
for things like freeing memory that you want to not look like a memory leak
by any diagnostics that check for unfreed memory on quit.

/**
This template class allows you to easily register a singleton class T with the
shutdown registry, so that it will get cleaned up at shutdown. The requirements
for the class T are simple:
<p>
<ol>
<li>The class must implement this (public or friend-accessible) function:<br>
<code>
static void deleteInstance();
</code>
<li>When you create the instance, also create the shutdown handler; that is, you only
create one shutdown handler, so you may as well do it when you create the singleton
instance:<br>
<code>
gInstance = new MyClass(params);
new VSingletonShutdownHandler<MyClass>();
</code>
<li>If you wish to allow deleteInstance() or instance() to be thread-safe, you need to
protect the instance with a VMutex. If you can be sure the first
call to instance() will be from the main startup thread, you don't need a mutex for it;
if you trigger the shutdown registry cleanup after all threads but main have terminated,
then you don't need a mutex for deleteInstance() either. Generally I would suggest
using a mutex unless you know that removing it is a useful performance optimization and
is safe to do.
</ol>
