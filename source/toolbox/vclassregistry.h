/**
VClassRegistry provides a mechanism for instantiating objects dynamically
at runtime based on class IDs. This allows you to write code that obtains
a class "ID" and then calls the registry to instantiate the corresponding
type of object. You decide what an ID is (it's just a string, so the simple
thing is to use the class name as the ID, perhaps qualified with something
akin to a Java package name to ensure uniqueness across a global name space),
and provide the factory function.

If you prefer, you can create multiple registries and register your
class factories with them as you see fit. However, the easiest way to use
the registry is to just use the singleton that it creates automatically.

To do this, all you need to do is define a class factory for each registered
class. Two macros are provide to make this trivial to add in a consistent
fashion. Suppose you have class Foo for which you want a factory
registered with the global registry:

In foo.h:

    class Foo { .... };

    DEFINE_CLASSFACTORY(Foo);

In foo.cpp:

    DECLARE_CLASSFACTORY(Foo);

When you need a Foo object but don't know the actual type until runtime
(let's say the string <code>name</code> is given to you during some
kind of deserialization process where everything is a subclass of Foo, and all
of the Foo subclasses also have class factory macros) you just do this:

    Foo* aFoo =
        (Foo*) VClassRegistry::registry()->instantiateObject(name);

The purpose of the above is to create a single FooFactory as a static
class variable, which will be created automatically at program startup,
that when constructed registers itself with the global registry. This
means that you don't have to explicitly register all your classes at
some central location in your code; it's almost automatic just by
defining the factory that it will get registered.

The method VClassRegistry::registry() is provided to ensure that when
the first attempt is made to register a class -- which will presumably
be at static initialization time -- the global registry will get
created exactly once, before it is actually accessed. This is because
the order of static initialization is not guaranteed, and we don't want
to clutter the caller's code with checks for the global variable being
non-NULL. This is both cleaner and fool-proof.

If you want a separate registry for a set of classes, just create your
own separate VClassFactory object, and an accessor function that makes
sure it's created upon first use, just like VClassRegistry::registry().
In other words, define your own "myRegistry()" function that looks
exactly like the code in VClassRegistry::registry() but uses your own
registry global rather than VClassRegistry::gRegistry.

In the class declaration of the class that will own your registry:

    public:
        static VClassRegistry* myRegistry();
    protected:
        static VClassRegistry* gRegistry;

In the class implementation:

    // static
    VClassRegistry* ThingThatOwnsMyRegistry::gRegistry = NULL;

    // static
    VClassRegistry* ThingThatOwnsMyRegistry::registry()
        {
        // We're using the "create on first use" idiom here.
        if (gRegistry == NULL)
            gRegistry = new VClassRegistry();

        return gRegistry;
        }

Then your FooFactory would only have to change its constructor from
the above example to:

    FooFactory(const VString& classID) : VClassFactory(classID)
        { ThingThatOwnsMyRegistry::registry()->registerClass(this); }
