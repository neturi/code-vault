/**
VSingleton is a template class that provides a "singleton holder" that
implements the "singleton" pattern behavior for a class T you write. As of
this version, the only key requirement of class T is that it has a default
constructor, which will be used when VSingleton instantiates it. The behavior
VSingleton gives you is:
<p>
<ul>
<li>There is only 1 instance of T.
<li>The instance of T is not instantiated until the first time it is accessed
(via the instance() method). This is sometimes called "lazy initialization".
<li>The instance of T can be deleted, at which point another instance of
T may be permitted or prohibited.
<li>The instance of T can be set for (almost) automatic deletion during program
shutdown.
<li>Callers access the instance of T by calling the holder's instance() method.
<li>Callers may destroy the instance of T by calling the holder's deleteInstance()
method.
<li>It makes no sense to create multiple holders of the same class T. There will
still only be one instance of T since the holders will share the same static
variables (such as the instance pointer), but the holders' policy flags could
have differing behavior, which would be strange.
</ul>
<p>
You should define T's constructor and destructor private, and the template
class a friend, so that only the template class can create and destroy the
instance of T. Otherwise, the singleton behavior can be circumvented.
<p>
VSingleton can work with the VShutdownRegistry to make sure that the
instance of T is cleaned up at shutdown, so you don't leak global resources
(even in a simple case, a leak-detecting debugger will infer that there is
a leak if the instance of T exists at program exit).
<p>
When you construct the VSingleton<T>, you pass it four "policy" flags:
<p>
<ul>
<li>HolderDeletionPolicy. If you're using the VShutdownRegistry, you need to
specify whether the VSingleton itself can be deleted. (Note that I am
referring to the VSingleton, not the instance of T.) If it's allocated
via "new", it should be deleted, so pass kDeleteHolderAtShutdown. If it's
a global variable, it must not be deleted, so pass kDontDeleteHolderAtShutdown.
(It would be strange to declare it as a local variable! But if you did, it
would have to be flagged like a global variable since it cannot be deleted
with operator delete.) If you specify kDeleteHolderAtShutdown, the
VShutdownRegistry will delete the VSingleton immediately after it tells it
to shutdown().
<li>ThreadSafetyPolicy. If you know that the instance will be created during
the main thread's startup with no possibility of other threads trying to
access/create the instance at the same time, you can avoid the overhead of
locking, in which case pass kSimpleAccess. However, you should not normally
assume this is the case, and should thus normally pass kThreadSafeAccess.
- ShutdownPolicy. If you want the singleton deleted when the program shuts
down, pass kRegisterForShutdown. Otherwise, pass kDontRegisterForShutdown.
<li>ResurrectionPolicy. If you want to allow the instance of T to be re-created
after it was previously created and destroyed, pass kAllowResurrection.
Otherwise, pass kDontAllowResurrection, which will cause a VException to
be thrown if someone tries to access the instance() after it was previously
destroyed. This situation would typically arise if you invoke the
VShutdownRegistry before all non-main threads have terminated, or if some
singleton's shutdown/cleanup procedure access another deleted singleton's
instance. These are typically design bugs that need to be re-thought.
</ul>
