 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * The Code Vault is a cross-platform C++ foundation library. Its first aim is to help you
 * avoid the hassles of developing C++ code that works on different platforms, compiled
 * by different compilers, and referencing different standard library implementations. Its
 * second, larger aim is to provide a solid, pleasant, understandable object-oriented library of
 * classes that implement a variety of fundamental services not provided by the language
 * or standard library, and services which vary on each native platform (such as threading,
 * file access, socket i/o, time functions, strings, logging, messaging, session management, etc.).
 *
 * \section dependencies_sec Dependencies
 *
 * The Code Vault has only one external dependency, and that is "smart pointers". This means
 * that you either need to be using a C++11 compiler (which supplies std::shared_ptr and
 * related classes) or you need to have the Boost library (which supplies boost::shared_ptr).
 * If using a C++11 compiler, you don't have to do anything; if using Boost, then you must
 * uncomment the symbol definition "VAULT_BOOST_SHARED_PTR_INCLUDE" in vconfigure.h to tell
 * Vault to include the requisite Boost headers; and you need to have the Boost include
 * directory in your project include paths.
 *  
 * \section gettingstarted_sec Getting Started
 *
 * For Mac OS X: open, build, and run the sample Xcode IDE project located at:
 *   extras/test_projects/mac/VaultPlatformCheck.xcodeproj
 *
 * For Windows: open, build, and run the sample Visual Studio IDE project located at:
 *   extras/test_projects/win/VaultPlatformCheck.sln
 *
 * Until a sample Makefile is provided, for Linux you currently need to create a Makefile
 * that references all of the .cpp and .h files except those in '_mac' or '_win' subdirectories.
 * The same approach can be used for Makefile-oriented builds on Mac OS X and Windows.
 *
 * The sample project has a main function from the 'unittest' subdirectory containing the
 * supplied unit tests, so running the built application perform's the Vault's self-tests.
 * You can replace the file 'vplatformcheck_main.cpp' with your own main, remove the 'unittest'
 * folder from the project (unless you wish to keep and call the unit tests), and then add
 * your own source code to the project.
 *
 * \section reference_sec Reference

    @defgroup vtypes Vault Data Types

    The file vtypes.h and the platform-specific version of the file it
    includes, vtypes_platform.h, define a core set of basic data types and
    preprocessor macros that facilitate platform-neutral code. Without these
    definitions, you would have to cope with the various quirks and
    behaviors of different compilers, libraries, and processors.

    <h2>Data Types</h2>

    <h3>Integers</h3>

    Whenever possible, you should just use int. If you are willing to assume
    that the world is now 32-bit or better, then you can treat int as
    "a signed integer that holds about +/- 2 billion", and if your data fits
    into that description, int is good because it is signed and general.
    However, there are cases where you need to use specific sized integer,
    perhaps unsigned, and the types Vs8, Vu8, Vs16, Vu16, Vs32, Vu32, Vs64,
    and Vu64 provide signed and unsigned definitions for 8, 16, 32, and 64
    bit integers. For example, if you are doing binary stream i/o, you'd better
    be certain of the exact number of bytes used in the stream to represent each
    particular integer value; thus, VBinaryIOStream speaks in these types and
    does not let you read and write the more ambiguous "int". The definition
    of a 64-bit integer is different across compilers, hence it is unsafe for you
    to use "long long" and expect it to work; thus the existence of Vs64 and Vu64,
    which work correctly even with MSVC++ 6.

    <h3>Floating-Point</h3>

    Because the single-precision "float" type in the language is ambigous and
    essentially dangerous, vtypes defines VDouble, which uses double precision.
    There is also a VFloat type, but in general you should avoid it because of
    loss of precision and the aforementioned dangers.

    <h3>File Sizes</h3>

    If you want to avoid writing code that breaks when encountering large files,
    it is best to use the type VFSize to represent file and stream sizes. Even in
    today's systems, some users work with files whose size exceeds what can be
    represented in 32 bits. A video file of 3GB is not that uncommon. You need
    64 bits, and that's how VFSize is defined. Alternatively, you could just use
    Vs64 (or even Vu64), and that would work just as well, although it reads as
    less obvious what its purpose is. The somewhat standard type size_t is
    useful, but it will not be 64 bits on most systems today, so the Vault does
    not use it to define stream-related sizes, in favor of a uniform use of
    VFSize.

    <h3>Collection Sizes</h3>

    The type VSizeType is defined as a uniform way of defining a type for
    the size of an STL collection. This is often a good clean way of defining
    the loop control variable for an STL iteration for-loop. You cannot just
    use "int" for those situations because it's the wrong type and strong compiler
    type-checking will complain; and it seems awkward to use a specific STL
    template-defined size_type because if you decide to use a different
    STL collection type, your control variable type should change, too. I'm not
    totally satisfied with this, but so far this seems like the best option.

    <h3>Strings</h3>

    See VString for the string class used everywhere in the Vault.

    <h3>Date and Time</h3>

    See VInstant and its relatives VDate and VTimeOfDay for the date and time
    representations used everywhere in the Vault.

    <h3>Byte Order</h3>

    Some compilers' libraries provide macros for invoking host-to-network order
    and network-to-host order byte swapping, such that they do nothing on "big
    endian" machines ("network byte order" means big endian in this terminology).
    However, not all such libraries provide these macros and functions, or don't
    provide them for all data types; so here we define a complete set of macros
    for all fundamental data types.

    In general, you should use VBinaryIOStream to read and write data in a
    byte-order-neutral fashion. In rare cases you may want to make sure your data
    is in host or network byte order, in which case you would use one of the
    V_BYTESWAP_* macros, all of which do the right thing -- which is "nothing" if
    the host order is network order. Finally, if you really need to do byte swapping
    explicitly, you can call one of the byte-swapping functions VbyteSwap16(),
    VbyteSwap32(), VbyteSwap64(), VbyteSwapFloat(), or VbyteSwapDouble() which
    swap bytes between network and host order (the two directions happen to be
    symmetric for big- and little-endian). These functions always swap the bytes,
    in contrast to the macros which are no-ops when running on a big-endian system.

    <h3>Constants</h3>

    There are a couple of things to note about defining and using constants.

    Because of certain compilers' limitations (namely MSVC++ 6), you cannot
    declare a 64-bit constant in the normal way if you want it to compile
    cross-platform. That is, "1LL" is unfortunately not going to work. Provided
    here is a macro CONST_S64 that will work with all compilers. So use
    "CONST_S64(1)" instead, to declare a 64-bit constant whose value is 1.
    Use CONST_U64 for unsigned values.

    MSVC++ 6 also is incompatible with the normal way of declaring class static
    constants (e.g., "const int kMyConstant = 42;"). The Vault provides a macro
    called "CLASS_CONST" that allows you to declare class static int constants
    in a way that will compile with MSVC++ 6: "CLASS_CONST(int, kMyConstant, 42);".
    As of Code Vault 2.5, I am no longer using this macro, but it's still defined
    in case you need it (please just dump the piece of junk MSVC++ 6 compiler and
    get the freely downloadable and reasonably decent VC++ 8 instead).

    There are constants defined for the miniumum and maximum possible values of each
    integer data type: V_MIN_S8, V_MAX_S8, V_MAX_U8, V_MIN_S16, V_MAX_S16, V_MAX_U16,
    V_MIN_32, V_MAX_S32, V_MAX_U32, V_MIN_64, V_MAX_S64, V_MAX_U64.
    These are defined as Vs64 values so that they are always valid and interchangeable.
    You should use these in place of the typical POSIX macros because not only are
    the POSIX macros not available on all platforms, but they aren't necessarily
    provided for 64-bit values; and you should use them instead of the standard C++
    function templates may not be available at all.

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

    There are macros defined to wrap min(), max(), abs(), and fabs(), such that they
    will still work if the standard C++ function templates are not available: V_MIN,
    V_MAX, V_ABS, V_FABS. You should use these if you want to be sure your code compiles
    cross-platform.

    A macro ASSERT_INVARIANT is defined that calls "this->assertInvariant()" if you
    are building in debug mode. This allows you to define a method assertInvariant()
    in any class, and call this macro to test your invariants. The rule of thumb is
    that you should test the invariants at the end of every (public) constructor,
    test the invariants on entry to each method, test the invariants on exit of any
    non-const method. See "C++ FAQs" item 224. The Vault uses this mechanism itself in
    several of its classes that are suited to invariant testing.

/*
These three defines are to future-proof against compile errors when overloading functions
that take various integer types. Which overloads are actually identical (and thus duplicates)
depends on the compile flags. Specifically, and in most 32- and 64-bit environments,
Vs32 = int32_t = int, so you can't have an overloaded function with both int and Vs32 versions.
But if you use an ILP64 model, then Vs64 = int64_t = int, in which case the error would be if
you overload a function with both int and Vs64 versions. I don't yet have an example to know
how to detect ILP64, and all others (e.g., 32-bit and LP64) have int32_t = int, so for now we
just define the first one all the time (Vs32 / Vu32 are int / unsigned int), and therefore
where we have int overloads (VString assignment and increment, VAssert variants) we don't define
the 32-bit overloads. If you use ILP64, make this define conditional on something appropriate,
and we'll avoid defining the 64-bit overloads. The definition of size_t can also conflict with
unsigned int if, as Microsoft does, the headers declare it as such a typedef.
An enhancement would be to auto-detect or more conditionally define these; for now all supported
environments use the Vx32_IS_xINT model, and V_SIZE_T_IS_UNSIGNED_INT is handled in the platform
header for Windows, so that's not necessary.

Here is where we use a hierarchy of preprocessor symbols to control assertion behavior.
The hierarchy of user-definable symbols is:
  VAULT_ASSERTIONS_ENABLED
    V_ASSERT_INVARIANT_ENABLED
      V_ASSERT_INVARIANT_classname_ENABLED (for a given classname)

In vconfigure.h, you may define any or all of these symbols to 0 or 1 to force them off or on;
by default, V_ASSERT_ENABLED is on unless VAULT_ASSERTIONS_NOOP is defined; and the others inherit their state from
the level above.

Internally, we use the above symbols to define or leave undefined the following symbols:
  V_ASSERT_ACTIVE
    V_ASSERT_INVARIANT_ACTIVE
      V_ASSERT_INVARIANT_classname_ACTIVE (for a given classname)

This allows to the Vault code to simply #ifdef the existence of those symbols.

The following values for classname are implemented:
    VEXCEPTION
    VSTRING
    VDATE_AND_TIME
    VMESSAGE
